## Overview

This goal of this project is to develop a simple webpage having a Results and summary component and styling it using whatever I've learned so far in my front-end web development journey. It is also to provide useful resources that I found to be helpful during my learning journey for fellow newbie learners.

## My process
1. Build the html structure for the project using the given design as reference.
2. Figure out elements that need to be responsive and map out the structure where flexbox is needed.
3. Transform block level elements to flex containers & flex items using a custom utility class 'flex'.
4. Style the webpage in a cascading manner.
5. Finding solution to design & errors on resources such as'google','w3schools','stackoverflow'.
6. Implementing solutions.
